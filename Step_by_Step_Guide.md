Detailed Guide for Data Migration and Analysis Project
1. Work Environment Preparation
a. Python Installation
The project requires Python 3.8 or a higher version. If you do not have Python installed yet, visit the official page python.org to download and install the suitable version for your operating system. Ensure to check the option that adds Python to the PATH during installation.

b. Virtual Environment Setup
It is advisable to use a virtual environment to manage the project dependencies separately. To create a virtual environment, execute:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
Activate the virtual environment with:

On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux: source env/bin/activate
c. Dependency Installation
With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib psycopg2-binary configparser
Note that psycopg2-binary is used to avoid the need to compile the psycopg2 package from source code.

2. Data Preparation
a. Source Data
Ensure you have the CSV file with the data to be analyzed. This file must be free of errors and in a format that Pandas can read without problems. If the project includes specific file paths, update them to reflect the correct location of the file in your system.

b. Database Access Configuration (if applicable)
If the project interacts with a PostgreSQL database, set up the appropriate credentials and connection parameters. This can be done directly in the script or through an external configuration file, which is preferable for security and maintainability reasons. Use configparser to read these parameters from an .ini file.

3. Script Execution
a. Script Verification
Before running the script, review the code to understand its flow and ensure that all the paths and configuration parameters are correct.

b. Execution Command
Run the script from the terminal or command line, ensuring the virtual environment is activated:

bash
Copy code
python ETL_Workshop_01.py
4. Data Load Review
The script will display the first rows of the DataFrame to verify the correct importation of the data. Carefully review this output to ensure that the data has been loaded correctly and matches expectations.

5. Next Steps and Analysis
After the initial load and data verification, consider the following steps to deepen the analysis:

Data Cleaning: Identify and correct inconsistencies, missing values, or erroneous data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to better understand the data.
Data Visualization: Create more complex charts to represent the relationships between different variables.
Modeling: Depending on the project's objectives, apply statistical modeling or machine learning techniques.
6. Documentation and Maintenance
Carefully document each step performed, including data preparation, analysis, and conclusions. Keep the code clean and well-organized, facilitating future reviews or extensions of the project.
